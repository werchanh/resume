  <p>Technical and project management lead for systems engineering activities in the areas of network and systems management, distributed and client-server systems, information technology, and communications.  Hands-on experience with rapid prototyping and integration of commercial off-the-shelf products.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Developed a telemetry monitoring system as a proof of concept of the usefulness of telemetry information in monitoring tactical radio links.  Previous link status monitoring was a simple up or down indication, whereas exposing the telemetry information enabled predictive monitoring before link failure.  The proof of concept was so successful, the prototype was further developed and fielded to U.S. Army units.  As a subsequent effort, extended the concept to enable monitoring of supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems using standard simple network management protocol (SNMP) based commercial off the shelf software.</p>
